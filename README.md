# web-developpement-practice
This repository is simply a place where I store my web developpement code. I'm just starting web developpement and I'm going to try to do
at least 5 challenges for practice. The challenges I do here are just for me to learn about the basics of the languages I'm learning,
and if you're just starting to learn the same languages feel free to try the same projects.
