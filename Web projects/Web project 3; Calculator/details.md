# Objective
The goal of this project is to make a functional calculator. The reason I want to make a calculator is because my previous two projects focused more on HTML and CSS, so a calculator is a good opportunity to focus on Javascript. I may also need to use PHP for retrieving data, but at the time of writing this I'm not sure.

# Goals
- Functional
    - The calculator must be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. (required)
    - The calculator can do square roots and powers. (optional, prefered)
    - The calculator can store variables (probably only x, y, z). (optional, would like)
- Interface
    - The calculator has to be able to recieve numbers (maybe buttons, forms, ect, don't know how currently). (required)
    - Preferably looks nice.
