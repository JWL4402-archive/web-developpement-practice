                            I started learning Java at school for a Robotics club. Java was the first language I started learning. I've done some basic challenges that my club mentor<br>
                            has assigned me, but I haven't done much on my own for the language.

                    <button onclick='collapse(this, "cont2")' class="collapsible">HTML</button>
                    <div class="content" id="cont2">
                        <p>
                            Even before learning Java, I knew a little bit about HTML. However, I was young and knew close to nothing about coding so I didn't learn very much. <br>
                            I started to somewhat seriously learn HTML during the March break of 2020, because of the extra free time I had due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This <br>
                            webpage is actually my second real attempt at putting my basic HTML knowledge into practice.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <button onclick='collapse(this, "cont3")' class="collapsible">CSS</button>
                    <div class="content" id="cont3">
                        <p>
                            I started learning CSS at the same time I started to learn HTML and Javascript, during March break 2020, because prior to the break my leader had assigned <br>
                            me a challenge in Javascript, and after completing it I started to develop my knowledge of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <button onclick='collapse(this, "cont4")' class="collapsible">Javascript</button>
                    <div class="content" id="cont4">
                        <p>
                            I started learning Javascript when my robotics club mentor challenged me to complete a simple task in a language I've never used before, Javascript, prior <br>
                            to the challenge, I hadn't really tried to learn a language apart from Java, so I accepted and got to work. In order to complete the challenge, I had to <br>
                            learn some basic HTML and CSS too, which got me interested in those three languages. After that, I started my attempt to learn basic web developpment.
