                                Java was the first language I tried learning seriously. I started learning it in robotics club,   
                                because it was the language we planned on using for the robot's code. I haven't used it much since 
                                March break because robotics club has been on hold due to the epidemic. I was learning Java from mid 
                                September to March break.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                                About a week before we got time off from school for March break, I asked my robotics mentor for some
                                challenges I could do to practice my code. He decided to assign me a challenge using Javascript
                                instead of Java because I had already finished all of the Java challenges. I found out that I needed
                                to know basic HTML in order to actually use Javascript to do basically anything, and as such I begun
                                to learn HTML. I had about a week of prior experience, however it was so long ago I didn't remember
                                any of it.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                                I started learning CSS at the same time I begun learning HTML and Javascript, during March break,
                                and for the same reason, my mentor had given me a challenge in Javascript. I found CSS and HTML to
                                be fairly beginner friendly languages, as many of the basics were simple and could be easily
                                learned. It took me a while to figure out how to use containers to make different sections, but that
                                was by far my biggest leap in knowledge, because it gave me so many new possibilites when coding.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                                When I firsted started learning Javascript to complete the challenge I had recieved, I was more
                                focused on the Javascript then HTML and CSS. I used only basic HTML and Javascript to display what
                                my scripts produced. After the challenge though, I started focusing more on the visual element
                                (HTML and CSS), rather than the scripts. As such, my two first projects in my Github repository have
                                far more CSS and HTML than Javascript.
