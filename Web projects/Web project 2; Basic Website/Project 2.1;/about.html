            <p>
                &emsp;      This project is my second project related to web design. My first project consisted of just a single webpage, so I thought  <br>
                        the next step in my web design journey would be to create a website composed of multiple pages. This website serves as a start  <br>
                        for my journey of developping my web design skills, so when I complete all my projects I can come back to this page to see the  <br>
                        progression in my developpement.

                &emsp;      Overall, I've spent up to 40 hours doing the first project and this projects first attempt. During that time, I've used     <br>
                        mostly HTML and CSS. My greatest challenges came with Javascript, because it wouldn't work even when I followed the guides      <br>
                        online. I've probably spent at least 100 cumulative hours coding at the time of writing, however the majority of them were with <br>
                        a different language (Java). Almost all of my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript come from W3Schools.com and online forums.
