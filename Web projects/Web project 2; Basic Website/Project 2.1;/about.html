            <h1>Details about this project</h1>
            <p>
                        This project is my second project related to web design. My first project
                        consisted of just a single webpage, so I thought the next step in my web design 
                        journey would be to create a website composed of multiple pages. This website 
                        serves as a start for my journey of developping my web design skills, so when I 
                        complete all my projects I can come back to this page to see the progression in 
                        my developpement.

            <h2>Learning progress</h2>
            <p>
                        Overall, I've spent up to 40 hours doing the first project and this projects 
                        first attempt. During that time, I've used mostly HTML and CSS. My greatest 
                        challenges came with Javascript, because it wouldn't work even when I followed 
                        the guides online. I've probably spent at least 100 cumulative hours coding at 
                        the time of writing, however the majority of them were with a different language
                        (Java). Almost all of my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript come from 
                        W3Schools.com and online forums.

            <h2>Mistakes</h2>
            <p class="last">
                        Over the course of making this website, I encounter multiple issues and made
                        multiple mistakes. I was having so much trouble that I decided to make a
                        second version from scratch in an attempt to fix my issues. Most of my issues
                        were with the Javascript code for the accordian section on the languages page.
                        There were many issues, and they can be read in the details.md file located in
                        the Github repository the code for this site can be found in. During the
                        creation of this website, I took a 14 day break and then returned to fix the
                        issues. Shortly after the break this website was completed.
